# 👋 Hi, I'm Abhinav

I build **production-ready web systems** — backend-heavy, performance-conscious, and designed to scale — while still caring deeply about clean user experience.

I enjoy working across the stack, from **database design and APIs** to **frontend delivery and infrastructure**, and I especially like solving real product problems rather than isolated demos.

---

## 🚀 What I Do

- Build **full-stack web applications** end to end
- Design **scalable backend architectures**
- Develop **AI-powered automation & agents**
- Optimize **database, cache, and search workflows**
- Deploy and manage apps on **VPS, Docker, and self-hosted platforms**

- Secure document storage and controlled downloads
- Payment gateway integration with webhook handling
- Purchase verification & access control logic
- SEO-friendly public pages
- Admin-focused workflows for content management
- Performance optimizations using **Redis caching**
- Clean separation of public, authenticated, and paid content

### What It Demonstrates
- End-to-end product ownership
- Backend-heavy decision making
- Real payment & security concerns
- Scalable data modeling
- Deployment and infrastructure responsibility

## 🛠 How I Think About Engineering

- Prefer **clarity over cleverness**
- Simple systems that scale beat complex ones that don’t
- Data flow should be predictable
- Debug before rewriting
- Optimize only where it actually matters
